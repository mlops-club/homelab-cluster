# MLOps Club Kubernetes Cluster 🐳

## Quick Start (set up cluster from scratch)

Prerequisites
1. fill out `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
2. install tailscale and join the tailnet

```bash
cd ./k3s-ansible
./run deploy
```

Now copy the kubeconfig file

```bash
ssh -t main@cluster-node-1 "sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml" > k3s-ansible/kubeconfig
# ^^^ prints it to the terminal, then copy and
pbpaste > ~/.kube/config
# ^^^ be sure to set server to https://cluster-node-1:6443
```

Install various operators for DNS and networking

```
cd ..
./install-helm-charts.sh
```

Try deploying some services to nginx and testing the connection

```bash
cd ./nginx-deployment
./deploy-all.sh
```

## K3s Deployment with Ansible

- [`k3s-ansible/`](./k3s-ansible/). This was taken from [this git repo](https://github.com/timothystewart6/k3s-ansible) NO modifications were made, except:
  - [./k3s-ansible/inventory/cluster/group_vars/all.yml](./k3s-ansible/inventory/cluster/group_vars/all.yml)
  - [./k3s-ansible/inventory/cluster/hosts.ini](./k3s-ansible/inventory/cluster/hosts.ini)
  - Deploy with `bash ./k3s-ansible/run deploy`.
  - Teardown with `bash ./k3s-ansible/run reset`.

Note, the `run` script uses `uv` and a `pyproject.toml` file which we added to make dependency management cleaner.

In [`all.yml`](./k3s-ansible/inventory/cluster/group_vars/all.yml), we only changed a few values from default:
- `system_timezone: America/Denver`
- `flannel_iface: enp1s0` Because the NUCs use that interface instead of `eth0`.
- `metal_lb_ip_range: 192.168.50.200-192.168.50.220` Because the NUCs are on a LAN with IPs in `192.168.50.(up to 199)` and the IPs assigned to pods by metallb must not overlap with those.


## Networking with Cloudflare/Tailscale

We managed to make both internal and external services accessible with pretty DNS names.

The [`nginx-deployment/`](./nginx-deployment/) contains manifests which show how this is done.

|----------------|-----------|------------|
| • **Reachable:** Internal only<br>• **DNS:** IP only<br>• **Protocol:** HTTP only<br><br>Service accessible only within the Tailscale network via an IP address. | • **URL:** [a tailscale IP known after deploy]<br>• **Manifest:** [manifest-internal-tailscale.yaml](./nginx-deployment/manifest-internal-tailscale.yaml)<br>• **Setup Guide:** [TAILSCALE_OPERATOR_SETUP.md](./nginx-deployment/TAILSCALE_OPERATOR_SETUP.md) | • **Tailscale operator:** Tunnels traffic to services within the Tailscale network |

## TLS/SSL with Traefik

Cloudflare can manage a single wildcard TLS cert for us.

> So we don't have to go through the pain of LetsEncrypt rate limits when we accidentally try to issue a cert more than 5 times in a day.

## Common issues

### Reaching the control plane

Set this line and make sure tailscale is enabled

```yaml
# ~/.kube/config
clusters:
  cluster:
    server: https://cluster-node-1:6443
```

### TLS errors with kubectl

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
Error from server (BadRequest): Unable to list "/v1, Resource=nodes": the server rejected our request for an unknown reason (get nodes)
```

Cause: When `./run reset` is run, new x509 certs are generated on the cluster nodes, which means the certs in `~/.kube/config` are out of date.

Fix: run 

```bash
ssh -t main@cluster-node-1 "sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml" > k3s-ansible/kubeconfig
```

then copy the resulting kubeconfig to the clipboard, and paste it to the right location with `pbpaste > ~/.kube/config`.
