# This file documents the annotation-based replication setup
# The actual annotations are added to the secret via the helm-install.sh script
# 
# Reflector uses annotations on the source secret to control replication:
#   reflector.v1.k8s.emberstack.com/reflection-allowed: "true"
#   reflector.v1.k8s.emberstack.com/reflection-auto-enabled: "true"
#
# These annotations tell Reflector to:
# - Allow replication of this secret (reflection-allowed)
# - Automatically replicate to all namespaces (reflection-auto-enabled)
#
# When cert-manager renews the certificate (every 90 days), Reflector will
# automatically update the replicated secrets in all namespaces, preventing
# stale certificates.
#
# Note: The annotations are added to the secret in helm-install.sh after
# cert-manager creates it.
