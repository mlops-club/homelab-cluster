# Context

## Objective

I'm trying to understand this repository and the tools inside it. 

## Context of what I know

I'm new to 
- K3s 
- Ansible
- MetalLB
- kube-vip

I have *some* familiarity with these, but am not an expert and am rusty.

- kubernetes

I have 3 servers on my desk that can be reached with auth that requires a password at host names:

- `main@cluster-node-1`
- `main@cluster-node-2`
- `main@cluster-node-3`
